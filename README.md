Poker Evaluator in Rust

The code ranks poker hands, and stores them in memory along with their rank. After that, this rank can be used to figure how strong a hand is and how it compares to other hands. It is something I built to explore Rust - the code is surely not optimal and in some regards quite pointless, but the results should be correct nonetheless.
